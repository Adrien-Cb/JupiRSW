# JupiRSW

This is a rotating shallow water model for studying vortices at a planet's pole.

## Install

# Libraries 

JupiRSW uses **NumPy**, **Xarray**, **SciPy** and **Matplotlib**.

# ffmpeg

**ffmpeg** is required to save animations as MP4. 
There are many builds available, you can for instance get one [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/).
Once installed, add the path to the ffmpeg executable in `config.py`:
```python
FFMPEG_PATH = R'C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe'
```
